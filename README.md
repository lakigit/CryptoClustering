# CryptoClustering
Module 19 challenge

In this challenge, use knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

01. In order to preparation of the data, use the `StandardScaler()` module from `scikit-learn` to normalize the data from the CSV file. This is the outcome.
